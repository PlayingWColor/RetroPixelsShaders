# Retro Pixels Shaders

The purpose of these shaders is to mimic the look and feel of retro games from the first half of the 90s. The main inspirations were initially just the playstation, but the Sega CD inspired the limited color palette. 

These shaders are a work in progress, so they may not work as intended under all circumstances. I haven't tested them in very many situations yet.

### Features:

- Limited Color Palette
- Dithered Lighting
- Dithered Colors
- Forced 320x240 resolution
- Vertex Jitter
- Affine Texture Mapping (NEW) : Textures will distort much like in old Playstation games.
- CRT Effect (NEW) : Enable from Shader Settings
